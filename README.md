My first solo app

My Grocery List App is my first solo project. This project took me roughly 6 hours to get the overall functionality working, while adding small adjustments over another few hours. 

This project was developed for users who are wanting to be more environmental friendly, wanting a way to remember things just from their phone.

Users are able to input items in the input field and will receive a bulletted list of the items they have input. If users wish, they are able to then remove the items.

A few things Id like to add to the app:
-Optimize for mobile use
-Increase / Decrease quantity
-Connect app to grocery store APIs
-Allow users to start typing a word such as "water" and have a list of other items pull up that start with "water" such as "watermelon"
