# Grocery-List
My first solo app

My Grocery List App is my first solo project. Users are able to input items in the input field and will receive a bulletted list of the items they have input.
If users wish, they are able to then remove the items. 

A few things I plan to add to the app:

-Increase / Decrease quantity
-Choose a store nearby & see if they have the item available
-Allow users to start typing a word such as "water" and have a list of other items pull up that start with "water" such as "watermelon"
